# Implementation Plan - GitHub Repository README

## Goal Description
Create a professional and comprehensive `README.md` file for the `assessment_of_wells_chile/Codes_for_GitHub` repository. This document will serve as the entry point for users to understand the project's purpose, the workflow across the six Jupyter notebooks, and how to replicate the analysis.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> Please review the descriptions of the notebooks and data sources to ensure they accurately reflect the project's current state and intent.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation
#### [NEW] [README.md](file:///C:/Users/m20000907/OneDrive - Colorado School of Mines/python_codes/assessment_of_wells_chile/Codes_for_GitHub/README.md)
The README will include the following sections:
1.  **Project Title & Overview**: Summary of the groundwater analysis in Chile.
2.  **Key Features**: High-level bullet points of what the code does (Data processing, Spatial consistency, Trends analysis, etc.).
3.  **Repository Structure**: A detailed breakdown of the 6 Notebooks:
    *   `1_Checking_DGA_Records.ipynb`: processing DGA records.
    *   `2_DGA_Analysis.ipynb`: spatial/temporal analysis of DGA rights.
    *   `3_Census_2017_2024_Analysis.ipynb`: census data comparison.
    *   `4_Water_Consumption_Estimation.ipynb`: water rights vs census estimation.
    *   `5_Evaluation_Trends_and_Forecast.ipynb`: trend models evaluation.
    *   `6_Trends_Assesment.ipynb`: final trend assessment.
4.  **Prerequisites**: List of required Python libraries (`pandas`, `geopandas`, `tensorflow`, etc.).
5.  **Data Sources**: Description of input data (DGA, Census, Piezometric).
6.  **Usage**: Instructions on the order of execution.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Render the markdown to ensure formatting is correct.
- Verify that all mentioned libraries are accurate based on the analysis.
- Confirm file paths and names match the actual repository structure.
